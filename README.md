# Crowdfunding_ETL

## Background
In this project, I built an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline in order to clean data and make it more readable in tables.

I used extracted and transformed the crowdfunding data using Python, Pandas, and dictionaries and list comprehensions to create 4 CSV files. Then, I loaded these files into a Postgres database in order to create an entity relationship diagram and table schema for the data.

## Features 
* Using Jupyter Notebook in order to extract and transform crowdfunding and contacts data from Excel files
* Creating DataFrames for Categories, Subcategories, Campaign, and Contact and then exporting DataFrames as CSV files
* Designing an ERD and schema for databases
* Using ERD and CSV files in order to create a PostgreSQL database and populate tables

## Installation
1. Clone repository
2. Install pandas, datetime Python packages
3. Set up PostgreSQL and create database called crowdfunding_db

## Built with
* Python
* Pandas
* PostgreSQL
